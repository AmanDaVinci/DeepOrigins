### 01_Matrix-Multiplication.ipynb:  
Optimizing matrix multiplication from scratch with:
1. Nested loops in standard Python
2. Array Slicing
3. Array Broadcasting
4. Einstein Summation in PyTorch
5. Standard PyTorch
   
*Matrix multiplication in standard PyTorch is about 45,000 times faster than using standard python*

### 02_Neural-Network-Forward-Pass.ipynb:  
Initializing a fully connected neural network

### 03_Neural-Network-Backpropagation.ipynb:  
Neural Network backpropagation in code from scratch
